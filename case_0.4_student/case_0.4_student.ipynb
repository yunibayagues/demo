    "Most people are used to using their computer via a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. Programmers more commonly use a CLI. With a GUI, you interact with programs using your mouse, menus, and buttons. Using a CLI, you can achieve the same things by only using text commands typed into your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are pros and cons to both approaches. Generally speaking, CLIs have a steeper learning curve. If you're not used to them, you'll be slower in the beginning than if you just used a mouse. However, once you conquer the learning curve you can be far more efficient and productive using CLIs over GUIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other advantages of CLIs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Power:** GUIs offer only a subset of features that are actually available for a given program. By using a CLI, you will have more direct control and can access many more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conformity:** CLIs are often the same, or very similar, across a wide variety of machines and over time. CLIs from 20 years ago will often still work on modern machines, while every update to a program that uses a GUI tends to move controls around and add/remove others.\n",
